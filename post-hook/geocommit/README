# geocommit post commit hook service

This is a post commit hook service that can be used to
push your geocommit data to the geocommit servers.

## Usage

On bitbucket:
  Add http://geocommit.appspot.com/ or your own server (if you installed the
  service) as a POST service.

## Installation

Compile the hook:
 $ lein compile
Build and deploy a uberwar:
 $ lein uberwar

This requires the leiningen-war plugin.

## Issues
There is a known issue with recent leiningen. Leiningen will not compile
compojure correctly, resulting in an unknown class compojure.response.Renderable.
You need to copy a correctly compiled compojure into the war/WEB-INF/classes
directory to work around this, or build a uberwar.
